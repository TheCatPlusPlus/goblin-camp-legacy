--- Goblin Camp ---

About:
Goblin Camp is aiming to be a roguelike city builder with an emphasis on
macromanaging the economy and military. I've drawn inspiration from games
such as Anno 1404, Dwarf Fortress and Dungeon Keeper.

Goblin Camp is open source, the full source is available at:
http://bitbucket.org/genericcontainer/goblin-camp
Code contributions are welcome!

Version 0.1:
This is the initial release, and as such is quite bare bones.
Please report all bugs in the Bug Report forum at:
http://www.goblincamp.com/forum/

Short Instructions:

Right-click to access and exit the menu, and choose your actions from there.
Middle-click moves back one level.
Press the 'h' key down (and keep it pressed down) to see keyboard
help text. Basically there are keyboard shortcuts for most of the
menus, and you can use the numbers 0-9 to choose a menu item.
The numberpad can be used for movement, press shift to move in
larger increments. The numberpad enter key is equivalent to a
left-click, Esc exits from menus.

Shift can also be pressed down in the Stock Manager screen to
adjust the minimums in larger increments.
Also the Stock Manager has a text input field, you can just start
typing and it will filter the results based on your input.

Known Issues:

Loading a game while a game is ongoing can cause problems as the
loading system hasn't been fully implemented. Loading a game without
a running one already in progress should work though.
