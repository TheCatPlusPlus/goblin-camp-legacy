--- Goblin Camp ---

About:
Goblin Camp is aiming to be a roguelike city builder with an emphasis on
macromanaging the economy and military. I've drawn inspiration from games
such as Anno 1404, Dwarf Fortress and Dungeon Keeper.

Goblin Camp is open source, the full source is available at:
http://bitbucket.org/genericcontainer/goblin-camp
Code contributions are welcome!

Version 0.1:
This is the initial release, and as such is quite bare bones.
Please report all bugs in the Bug Report forum at:
